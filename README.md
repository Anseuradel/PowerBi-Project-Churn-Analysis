# Project Overview 
## Objective : 

The goal of this project is to learn and apply data analysis using Power BI, one of the most widely used business intelligence tools in modern organizations. Power BI offers powerful capabilities for:

- Data cleaning and transformation

- Data modeling

- Interactive visualization

- Business-focused storytelling

Mastering Power BI is a strong asset for any data analyst, as it allows you to communicate complex insights in a clear, interactive, and professional way.
This project also serves as a demonstration of my analytical skills to recruiters, data professionals, and anyone interested in data-driven decision making.

## Data Source : 

The dataset used is the IBM Telco Customer Churn Dataset, which contains information about 7,043 fictional telecom customers in California during Q3.

It includes:

- Customer demographics

- Subscription information

- Services used (Internet, Phone, Streaming, etc.)

- Billing & charges

- Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)

- Churn labels and churn scores

- Satisfaction ratings

I chose this dataset because customer churn is one of the most critical challenges for telecom companies. As customers, we often notice how aggressively telecom providers try to retain us when we attempt to cancel a subscription.
This project allowed me to step into the role of a telecom data analyst, uncovering churn patterns and providing actionable insights to improve retention.

Additionally, using a public IBM dataset avoids exposing any sensitive or proprietary company data.

## Technology : 

For this end-to-end project, I used:

- Power BI → data understanding, cleaning, modeling, DAX measures, and dashboard design

- Power Query → data transformation

- Figma → creation of a clean, modern dashboard layout and UI components

- GitHub → version control and project documentation

## Impact : 

This project aims to:

- Strengthen my practical skills in data analysis and business intelligence

- Build a professional portfolio piece

- Provide clear, data-driven insights to reduce customer churn

- Identify customer behaviors, risk factors, and retention opportunities

By combining strong analytics with thoughtful UI design, this project demonstrates both technical and storytelling skills—essential for successful BI and data analytics work.
